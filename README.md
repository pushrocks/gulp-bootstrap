# gulp-bootstrap
works with gulp, but does nothing. Use it to bootstrap your own gulp plugin with TypeScript, Travis and npm.

This npm package comes with everything you need to start your own gulp plugin.

We recommend modifying the ts/index.ts file, 
then run `npm install` to install the dev dependencies
and use `npm test` to compile the TypeScript file.
